Paperless Orchestrator is a state-of-the-art document assistant that bridges the gap between raw file storage and intelligent knowledge management. Built on top of **Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and powered by **Gemini**, this tool transforms a standard document management system (Paperless-NGX) into a fully automated, agentic workspace.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Ingestion Workflow**: A specialized sequence of agents that analyze, categorize, and upload documents with zero manual entry.
- **Vision-Powered Analysis**: Leverages Google Gemini's native vision capabilities to "read" and understand document content (invoices, resumes, contracts) directly from images and PDFs.
- **Smart Entity Resolution**: Intelligently matches extracted data with existing correspondents, tags, and document types using fuzzy matching and normalization logic.
- **Natural Language Querying**: Talk to your documents. The search agent translates your questions into complex Paperless-NGX API filters.
- **Real-Time Debugging UI**: A premium Streamlit interface featuring live agent event tracking and session-isolated execution.

## 🧠 Cognitive Architecture (AI Agents)

The project showcases advanced agentic patterns using a hierarchical and sequential multi-agent design:

### 1. The Root Agent
The primary entry point. It understands user intent and routes tasks to specialized sub-agents.

### 2. Ingestion Pipeline (`SequentialAgent`)
This is where the magic happens. When a file is uploaded, three agents work in lockstep:
*   **Document Analyzer**: Uses Vision + OCR to extract titles, dates, companies, and keywords.
*   **Metadata Creator**: The "Reconciler". It lists existing tags and correspondents, performing smart matching (normalization + Jaccard similarity) to avoid duplicates and ensure a clean database.
*   **Document Uploader**: The final step. It compiles all gathered IDs and files to perform a multi-part POST request to the Paperless API.

### 3. Search Agent
Capable of listing, searching, and detailing documents via natural language.

## 🏗️ Technical Expertise: Challenges Overcome

During the development of this orchestrator, several critical agentic design challenges were solved:
- **State Management in Streamlit**: Implemented a session-isolated reset mechanism to ensure that each document ingestion starts with a clean slate, preventing context leakage between unrelated files.
- **Async Event Loop Harmony**: Solved the "Loop already running" conflict in Streamlit using `nest_asyncio` and custom runner wrappers, allowing the ADK's asynchronous events to stream directly to the UI.
- **Tool-State Bridging**: Designed specialized tools that bridge the gap between the LLM's reasoning and the Paperless API requirements, ensuring IDs are persisted across sub-agent transitions.
